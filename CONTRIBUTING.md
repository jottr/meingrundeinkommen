## What you will need:

- docker installed on your system.
- A database dump (until we have seed data)
- To build the `docker-compose.yml` you will need to the two environment files: `.mge_rails.env` and `.secrets.env`
  - Both `.env` files should be populated. Please ask the maintainer for an example file
- An editorconfig plugin for your editor, so that your source file formatting follows basic conventions. See `.editorconfig` and [editorconfig.org](editorconfig.org) for more info.
